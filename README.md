Gerardo Hernandez's weather app exercise

In this repository there is the Weather app project, with source code, properties files and the html and js files to query the cities.

To run the project, open the terminal and go to the cloned repsoitory, enter forlder weatherapp and then type:

		mvn clean install

Once the artifact was succesfully built type

		mvn spring-boot:run

Once the application is up and running, open your browser and type the next address:
http://localhost:8090/resources/index.html

Also there is a swagger to make aditional queries to the weather app, in your browser type 
http://localhost:8090/swagger-ui.html

and you will be able to make some more test to the application.
